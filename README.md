Using mysql to edit an employee database


<!-- Create DB and basic tables, input info just to ensure it populates in the correct areas

Need individual qualification files in 'lib'

index.js will hold functions for inquirer prompts and what to do with the data chosen name/role/edit/update
  - gotta remember CRUD and GET/POST/PUT/DELETE(?)
  
No visual webpage to be created but does a file need to be created? -->
